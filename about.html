          <p>There is an optional drop 1/2 way down. Great views over the valley. Great trail, with amazing views, but may see a lot of traffic. The area can be accessed from the end of Densmore's Lane, the end of Old Petty Harbour Road and from Huntingdale Drive. High elevation trails are clear May-October, bring plenty of water.         </p>
          <p>It's fire road the entire way, absolutely zero singletrack. 6 mile thrill ride through the dense pine forest of the park. Tree is elevated, so not rideable for most. The bottom portion of the trail is fast, loose and tight. Most climbs are of the paved/fireroad variety, most descents are a mix of loose rock, fixed rock, and good dirt.</p>
          <p>Rose meadows and finishing with this trail. From Lake Imaging Road it is a steady but not steep climb to the high point just before the intersection with Hooker Creek Trail. You now have to ride down an asphalt trail and cut off onto a gravel trail before getting back to the old single track. Drop in off a shallow rock slab and then whip through a few tight berms. Trail full of berms and fun features!</p>
